        <h2> <u>Purpose: </u></h2>

        <p>
            The reason I am creating this technical journal is to track my progress within my Software Engineering career.
            Prior to this journal, I had only ever created projects as class assignments and had never created my own personal projects.
            I hope that by the end of this technical journal I have created a handful of personal projects which I could cite in my resume
            and hopefully give myself a betternchance of getting hired in the future. I also hope to aquire a few new software skills and learn a
            little bit of programming languages that I am not very familiar with.
        </p>

        <h2> <u>Day 1 - March 14th, 2024 (Website Development): </u></h2>

        <p>
            My first project that I am going to be creating is my own website from scratch. I will be coding everything that goes into this website by
            myself rather than using a website developer like Wix.com. I began by watching multiple youtube videos of people explaining how to create websites from scrach
            and realized that one key feature to all of these websites is that they use HTML programming language, which I was not very familiar with. So, my next step
            was to look into how code in HTML. So, I went back onto youtube and spent a few hours researching how to code in HTML. Today I did not accomplish any physical
            code on my laptop but rather just learned about how I could start this website.

        <h2> <u>Day 2 - March 16th, 2024 (Website Development): </u></h2>

        <p>
            The goal for Day 2 was to begin my website. I wanted to test out some of the HTML features that I learned about on Day 1. I just began inserting some of these
            features. The first feature that I added was a link to an external source. The next feature I added was an image to appear on the website. After that I created
            generic fruit lists, using both a bulleted list and numeric list, each with a sublist within it. Finally, I added a generic table to my website with table
            headings as well as table data. Below is the work I accomplished Day 2.

        <h2> <u>Day 3 - March 21st, 2024 (Basic Calulator): </u></h2>

        <p>
            The goal for Day 3 was to create a basic calculator using Java. I already had a basic understanding of Java however, I did not have much experience
            designing anything in Java. So, I looked up how to create actual apps in Java and after reseaching this information for about a half hour, I began trying
            to create my own app which consisted of the basic calculator function, which I already knew how to program. The process of designing the calculator was tedious
            due to the fact that I had to "trial and error" my code to get it the way I wanted it to look. I tried looking up how to get my program embedded into my
            website but I found that embedding my program into here would take a lot longer than I would have wanted it to. So instead, I have just decided to upload photos
            of my program running below:

        <p>
            I was orginally going to try to get my Day 3 project embedded. However, I decided that rather than spending a bunch of my time trying to
            add my last project to the website, I would rather do another project. Today I wanted to create a simple game that can be played
